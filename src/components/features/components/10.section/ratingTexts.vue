        I should buy a lifetime subscription to @Todoist. It seriously runs my
        life. Work projects, groceries, birthday gift reminders. It’s
        essentially my personal assistant most of the time.

        Todoist made my life drastically better, it helped me declutter my brain
        to focus on the important things. Because of Todoist, I was able to read
        15 books in 2 months, learn iOS development and spend more time with my
        family

        By using Todoist every day I’ve become more productive tan anytime in my
        life. I can’t tell how much I love your software. It’s the first thing I
        look at in the AM and the last thing I do before bed, organize next days
        tasks. Truly love it!
